# swim

This is a Haskell implementation of the [SWIM epidemic gossip protocol](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf): Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership Protocol.

Overall, I'm aiming for functionality rather than performance or robust failure handling. This is my first Haskell project so I want to set my expectations accordingly :)
